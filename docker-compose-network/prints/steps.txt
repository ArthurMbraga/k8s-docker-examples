1st step: Download updated images
  docker login

  docker pull mysql:8.0
  docker pull oaisoftwarealliance/oai-amf:v2.0.0
  docker pull oaisoftwarealliance/oai-smf:v2.0.0
  docker pull oaisoftwarealliance/oai-upf:v2.0.0
  docker pull oaisoftwarealliance/trf-gen-cn5g:focal

  docker pull oaisoftwarealliance/oai-gnb:develop
  docker pull oaisoftwarealliance/oai-nr-ue:develop

  docker logout

2nd step: Deploy network

docker-compose up -d mysql oai-nrf oai-amf oai-smf oai-spgwu oai-ext-dn

I had to run it with sudo instead
change the variables in docker-compose.yml
services.mysql.image to mysql:5.7
services.mysql.healthcheck.retries to 5

3rd step: check status

Problem in the mysql-healthcheck.sh with LF and CRLF

docker-compose ps -a 

4st step: ifconfig

5th step: OAI gNB in RF simulator mode and in Standalone Mode

6th step: Deploy OAI NR-UE in RF simulator mode and in Standalone Mode

on docker-compose.yaml ih had to remove the flag --sa because it is not used anymore
i removed it from services.oai-nr-ue.environment.USE_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS
and from services.oai-nr-ue2.environment.USE_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS

7th step: Making sure the OAI UE is connected:

8th step: 3.1. Check your Internet connectivity

9th step: Start the iperf server inside the NR-UE container
the command did not work iperf -B 12.1.1.2 -u -i 1 -s 
i ran the command ip addr show and realized that the ip address was 12.1.1.4 instead

10th step: Start the iperf client inside the ext-dn container

11th step: Undeploy
