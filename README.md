# K8s and Docker Examples

This repository contains the files and configurations for deploying two distinct projects as part of the **CSC7342 - Virtualization: Concept and Implementation** course. The tasks include deploying a full-stack application using Kubernetes and setting up a mobile network emulator with Docker Compose.

## Repository Structure

- `fullstack-k8s/`: Contains configurations and files for **Task 1**, the deployment of a full-stack application on a Minikube cluster using Kubernetes.
- `docker-compose-network/`: Includes Docker Compose files and scripts for **Task 2**, the deployment of a mobile network emulator.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Full-Stack Deployment with Kubernetes
The goal is to deploy a full-stack application (frontend, backend, and database) using Kubernetes in a Minikube cluster. Configurations include Kubernetes manifests for each component, ensuring a working and scalable application.

### Task 2: Mobile Network Emulator with Docker Compose
This task involves setting up a mobile network emulator using Docker Compose. Updated Docker images from the appropriate repositories are used, with modifications made to address compatibility issues.

## Report
A detailed report documenting the deployment steps, troubleshooting, and results is available in this repository. Screenshots and explanations are included to provide further insights into the implementation.
